# Github Wiki Generator

A small tool to generate GitHub Wiki Pages for documenting code file by file.

Ever had any of these thoughts?
- I wish I could have someone document my code.
- I wish there was an explanation for each file in this new codebase.
- Man I need to go through all these files to understand what they do.

No? Well, I did. So I made this tool to help me out. It generates a wiki page for each file in the repository, with a brief description of what the file does and how it works. The script uses the Gemini API to generate the wiki pages, so you need to have a Gemini API key to use it.

And as the name suggests, it generates wiki pages for GitHub repositories. The script is designed to be run from the command line, and it takes a single argument: the path to the directory containing the code files. The script will then generate a wiki page for each file in the directory and its subdirectories in the exact folder structure the code is in.

Here's a small demo of the script in action, generating wiki pages for itself:

## Features
- Generates a wiki page for each file in the repository.
- Supports Code for all languages.
- Organizes files into folders with the same name as in the code.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add environment variables for the Gemini API key and GitHub API key:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
    python3 -m src --repo path/to/your/repo --output optional/path/to/output
    ```

## Available parameters
- `--repo`: Path to the directory containing the code files. Must be provided.
- `--output`: Path to the output directory for the wiki pages. Default is `wiki`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Markdown (for generating wiki pages)
- A Gemini API key (for generating wiki pages)

## FAQs

### Q: How do I add the Gemini API key?
A: You can add the Gemini API key by setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. The file should look like this:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Q: How do I add the GitHub API key?
A: You can add the GitHub API key by setting the `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. The file should look like this:
```
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
```

### Q: How do I run the script?
A: You can run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python -m src --repo path/to/your/repo --output optional/path/to/output
```

### Q: How do I generate wiki pages for a specific file?
A: You can generate wiki pages for a specific file by providing the path to the file in the `--repo` parameter. The script will generate a wiki page for that file only.

**NOTE**: This doesn't work with GitHub repository URLs. The script will clone the repository and generate wiki pages for all files in that repository.

### Q: How do I generate wiki pages for all files in a directory?
A: You can generate wiki pages for all files in a directory by providing the path to the directory in the `--repo` parameter. The script will generate wiki pages for all files in that directory and its subdirectories.

### Q: How do I generate wiki pages for a git repository?
A: You can generate wiki pages for a git repository by providing the path to the repository in the `--repo` parameter. The script will clone the repository and generate wiki pages for all files in that repository.

**NOTE**: The script can only access the GitHub repository using the `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN`. If you don't have access to the repository, you will need to provide a personal access token with the appropriate permissions.

### Q: How do I generate wiki pages for a specific language?
A: The script is language-agnostic and will generate wiki pages for all files in the specified directory, regardless of their language. However, you can filter the files by language by modifying the script to include only the desired file extensions.
